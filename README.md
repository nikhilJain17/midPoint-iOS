# midPoint-iOS
Find the optimal place to meet up with friends. Developed at CodeDay NJ 2015 by Rishi Masand and Nikhil Jain

Enter the place you want to visit, select your friends from a contacts picker, and midPoint determines not only
the midpoint of all the addresses, but it also finds the closest place of interest to that midpoint!
